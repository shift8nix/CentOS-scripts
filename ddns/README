Bash script for maintaining ddns source rule in firewalld

install bind-utils first

Scrip is called followed by domain name. By default "trusted" zone is selected:
./update_trusted_source.sh 49cc7564576x.sn.mynetname.net

But you can specify any other
./update_trusted_source.sh 49cc7564576x.sn.mynetname.net public

Set up cron to run it

how about adding more than one source? Use wrapper around this script. Create file called "domains" and write them one per line

then run it with:
./update_trusted_source_wrapper.sh
